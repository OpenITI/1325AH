90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text is genereally typed free of mistakaes; it is
    based on the third edition of Muassasat Al Bayt(Beirut,1991); alternate
    Arabic and Romanised humbers in the numberings of hadith,  HTML chars
    are often preserved towards the ending of each volume; occasional
    mistakes in hadith numberings; a PARATEXT - colophone of afterword by
    the author -at the end of colume 18 is missing from the EditPadPro
    version.
    NOTE OF THE REVIEWER (HRH): PARATEXT added. Editorial removed. Corrected headers
    that were not aligned in one line. Separated body text from the titles.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
