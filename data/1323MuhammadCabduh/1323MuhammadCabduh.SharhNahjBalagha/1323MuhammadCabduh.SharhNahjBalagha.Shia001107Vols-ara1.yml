90#VERS#COMMENT##: This text was originally filed as
    0406SharifRadi.NahjBalagha,  but it actually contains a sharh by
    Muhammad Abduh.  GVDB has deleted Abduh's footnotes in
    0406SharifRadi.NahjBalagha.Shia001107Vols-ara1 and annotated it.  The
    original file, without deletions, was renamed
    1323MuhammadCabduh.SharhNahjBalagha.Shia001107Vols-ara1 and cleaned up
    by PV.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
